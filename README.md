# Overly dramatic animal names bingo
**Bingo: Overly Dramatic Animal Names** is a theatrical take on the classic game of bingo. Instead of numbers, each bingo square features a ridiculously dramatic animal name, such as _Tormented Tarantula_, _Grieving Gecko_, or _Vengeful Viper_. Every name pairs a dramatic adjective with an animal of the same starting letter.

The animals are sorted into arrays based on the letters in **BINGO**:

**B**: Animals A–E

**I**: Animals F–J

**N**: Animals K–O

**G**: Animals P–T

**O**: Animals U–Z

Players can press the **Randomise** button to generate a fresh, randomly-filled card or use **Clear** to reset the card for a new game. A line in any direction means victory!

The game also includes a **host module** on the right side of the screen, designed for the person calling out the animals during gameplay. There are 95 uniquely dramatic animal names in total, ensuring high replayability and frequent laughter.

This project helped practise advanced array organisation, random selection without duplication, conditional logic, and modular component design.
